In Chapter 2 – Solution Architecture, we will review the broad landscape of Azure, and look at it with the eyes of a solution architect. More specifically, in this chapter we will cover the following topics:

•	The Solution Architecture  Map

•	Zoom in on the Different Workload Types

•	Zoom in on Containerization

•	Solution Architecture Use Case    

This chapter should give you the keys to design any type of solution with Azure, but you still need to refer to the other maps of this book, in order to dig deeper into in-depth, additional information.
